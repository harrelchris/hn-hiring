Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1&#x2F;5 of our Nation\u2019s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can\u2019t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.<p>Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we\u2019re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.<p>How can this be, and how can we change it?<p>Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.<p>Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.<p>But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn\u2019t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn\u2019t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn\u2019t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn\u2019t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?<p>Absolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna\u2019s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system\u2019s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.<p>In 2022, Nuna will power over $70Bn of healthcare payments for over 6.5mn patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.<p>Nuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry\u2019s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts. We have joined forces to create a more equitable health system for everyone.<p>Our dreams and ambitions to change healthcare as we know it are big.

My team is currently hiring for a Staff Software Engineer, primarily focused on backend skills, but who is comfortable jumping in to Android Studio, XCode, and TypeScript if necessary.<p>What we&#x27;re looking for<p>* Focused on Backend - Our backend is written in Go, using gRPC, GCP, Grafana, BigQuery for logs, BigTable &#x2F; datastore for storage, GCS for more storage.<p>* Comfortable jumping into other stacks - We do touch Java, Objective-C, Swift, TypeScript and Rust in some of the work we do<p>* Staff level impact - can build abstractions, and evolve them over time.<p>* Understands Mobile Apps and Websites - knows what an Android View is, UIKit View. Also knows how Web apps work and can understand the similarities and differences between apps and websites.<p>I started as an engineer on our SDK focused team working on deep internals of Android for a couple of years, but as our Mobile product started to get more customers, it became clear that the way we process Mobile sessions and find interesting insights wasn&#x27;t evolving. Our team is focused on helping teams build features for our Mobile product without having to understand the nitty gritty details of our SDK and mobile specific data structures.<p>If you&#x27;re not familiar with FS, here&#x27;s my take on the elevator pitch:<p>FullStory builds the best product analytics + session replay tools to help you understand what is frustrating your users and preventing them from using your Mobile App or Website. FullStory automatically capture what your users saw, what they interacted with, and all the information you&#x27;d need to power your product analytics, and lets watch how your users are using your app or website in a video-like experience, all with best in class privacy preserving features. With FullStory, You can delete all your manually instrumented Analytics.event(&quot;Login Clicked&quot;), and use our APIs to instrument only the events and data that matter to your app or site<p>I&#x27;ve worked here for 3.5 years, and I still think there&#x27;s so many interesting problems to solve and tools to build - here&#x27;s a little about the history and what excites me about our future.<p>For websites, the problem is a lot simpler - there are APIs to listen for changes to the HTML structure. There\u2019s nothing really close to that on mobile that provides any sort of structured vector representation of the UI and View Tree Hierarchy. Most of the competitors in this space are all either based on Bitmaps, screenshots, or don\u2019t provide any sort of a session replay experience (focusing on the analytics only case). Ours is based on different paradigm. We can selectively capture the colors, shapes, text, etc. that a View would draw to a canvas. Why is this better? If a view contains sensitive information, we can still capture the shapes, colors, paths of the view, but omit the actual text or bitmap content of that view.<p>This role is particularly exciting because we\u2019re just scratching the surface with what the higher fidelity our SDK captures can do. Imagine automatically surfacing when your users are spending a long time looking at ProgressBars or UIActivityIndicatorViews and how that impacts your conversions without needing to log any events, metrics or write code. Our team will have an outsized impact on the success of our mobile product, and the person who fills this role will strongly influence that impact and build a lot of the the fundamental building blocks that power those features.<p>If this sounds interesting, apply here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;56457178-344f-47c7-98f2-149197e821d5&#x2F;?ashby_jid=56457178-344f-47c7-98f2-149197e821d5\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;56457178-344f-47c7-98...</a>", "time": 1685648092, "type": "comment"}, {"by": "Shelnutt2", "id": 36155218, "parent": 36152014, "text": "TileDB, Inc. | Full-Time | REMOTE | USA | Greece | <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiledb.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiledb.com</a><p>TileDB is the database for complex data, allowing data scientists, researchers, and analysts to access, analyze, and share any data with any tool at global scale.
